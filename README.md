Sublime Text VCS Branch Plugin
==============

Sublime Text plugin that displays a few repo stats in the status bar. Written for ST3.

Only git and mercurial are supported at this time (since they're all I use).

Currently, the plugin displays:
* branch name
* modified file count
* incoming changeset count
* outgoing changeset count

![Example](http://i1217.photobucket.com/albums/dd393/gfizeek/vcs-branch.jpg "Image Example")

There is no config (yet). The plugin will figure out which VCS you're in.

It's still in its quick-and-dirty stage. Suggestions are very welcome!
